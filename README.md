# Energy Consumption and Efficiency Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves analyzing a dataset of energy consumption and efficiency from various sources. It demonstrates data preprocessing, regression analysis, classification, and visualization techniques to provide insights into energy usage and efficiency.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

The first step involves loading the energy dataset from a CSV file and preprocessing the data. This includes:
- Converting the date column to datetime format.
- Creating dummy variables for the energy source type.
- Filling any missing values in the efficiency column with the mean efficiency value.

### 2. Energy Consumption Prediction Using Linear Regression

Using the preprocessed data, we build a linear regression model to predict energy consumption based on source type and efficiency. This involves:
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training the linear regression model on the training data.
- Predicting the energy consumption for the testing set.

### 3. Efficiency Classification Using Random Forest

Create a classification model to categorize efficiency into three classes: Low, Medium, and High. This involves:
- Creating a new column for efficiency classification using quantiles.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training a Random Forest classifier on the training data.
- Evaluating the classifier's performance on the testing set.

### 4. Energy Source Recommendation

Based on the efficiency data, recommend the most efficient energy sources. This involves:
- Grouping the data by source type and calculating the mean efficiency for each type.
- Sorting the sources by their mean efficiency to identify the most efficient ones.

### 5. Visualization

Visualize the mean efficiency of different energy sources using Matplotlib to provide a clear representation of the data.
